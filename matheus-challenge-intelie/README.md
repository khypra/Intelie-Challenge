## Project tools

In this project, to help with css aligments and browser compatibility, were used the following references:
external css and flexbox alignment with compatibility

    #[auto-prefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)

    #[Flexbox](https://flexbox.help/)

For the Graph plotting i've choosen the Google Charts for react, that offers a compreensive interface with lots of chart options and personalization as well as easy implementation. #[Google charts](https://react-google-charts.com/)

The test library selected was Jest, because Jest runs tests in parallel which makes running the whole test suite so much faster. Also, you’ve got the possibility to use “--watch” and only run the tests affected by your changes in the editor

    #[Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

For the type definition of the models, it was installed the TypeScript extension with npm that offers versatility with model definition and instance of model objects.
